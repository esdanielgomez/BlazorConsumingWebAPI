Blazor is a framework on ASP.NET for building SPA (Single Page Application) applications with C# and HTML. In this repository, we can find the source code of an application that consumes Web API services for handling user data.

The project that contains the Web API implementation is located at this repository: [ASP.NET_WebAPI](https://github.com/esdanielgomez/ASP.NET_WebAPI).
